# Team Management Guide

## How to Associate Teams with Members

### Method 1: Team Dashboard UI (Recommended)

1. **Login to Team Dashboard**
   - Visit: `https://hjlees.com/team-dashboard`
   - Login with admin credentials: `admin@sambanova.com` / `admin123`

2. **Select a Team**
   - Choose a team from the dropdown menu
   - You'll see the team's todos and members

3. **Add Team Members**
   - Click **"Add Member"** button in Quick Actions
   - Search for users by email, username, or name
   - Select a user from search results
   - Choose their role (Member, Admin, Viewer)
   - Click **"Add Member"**

### Method 2: API Endpoints

#### Add Member to Team
```bash
POST /api/teams/{team_id}/members
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "user_id": "user-uuid-here",
    "role": "member"  // or "admin", "viewer"
}
```

#### Search Users
```bash
GET /api/teams/search/users?q=search_term
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

#### Get Team Members
```bash
GET /api/teams/{team_id}
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

### Method 3: Create Users and Auto-Assign

#### Create Demo Users
```bash
python create_users.py
```

This creates users and automatically adds them to the Demo Team:
- **manager@sambanova.com** / `manager123` (Admin role)
- **developer@sambanova.com** / `dev123` (Member role)
- **designer@sambanova.com** / `design123` (Member role)
- **tester@sambanova.com** / `test123` (Viewer role)

### Method 4: During User Registration

When users register via `/register`, they can be manually added to teams by admins using Method 1 or 2.

## Troubleshooting

### User Not Found
- Make sure the user exists in the system
- Check if they registered via `/register`
- Verify the search query is correct

### Permission Denied
- Ensure you have admin or owner role
- Check if you're logged in with correct credentials
- Verify the team exists and you're a member

### Team Not Found
- Make sure the team ID is correct
- Check if the team exists in your account
- Verify you have access to the team

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Demo Users**: Use the demo users created by the script
2. **Use UI for Testing**: The dashboard UI is easiest for demos
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure users have appropriate roles
4. **Test Team Collaboration**: Create todos and assign them to team members
5. **Verify Access**: Test that members can only see appropriate todos
