# Sambanova Team Collaboration System - Hackathon Project Story

## Inspiration

In today's fast-paced work environment, teams struggle to manage tasks across multiple platforms‚Äîswitching between todo apps, calendars, team chat, and phone calls creates friction and lost productivity. We envisioned a **unified productivity assistant** that could be accessed through **voice calls**, eliminating the need to open apps or log into dashboards while on the go.

The inspiration came from a simple question: *"What if you could manage your entire team's workflow just by making a phone call?"*

We wanted to create a system where:
- **Busy professionals** could create todos during their commute
- **Team leaders** could check project status hands-free
- **Remote workers** could collaborate without opening their laptop
- **Everyone** could access their personal calendar through natural conversation

---

5. `reminders_sambanova` - Time-based notifications
6. `calendar_events_sambanova` - Meeting/event tracking
7. `call_recordings_sambanova` - Voice interaction logs

### **Architecture Highlights:**

#### **LangGraph Agent Flow:**
```
User Call ‚Üí PIN Auth ‚Üí LangGraph Agent ‚Üí MCP Tools ‚Üí Database/Calendar
                ‚Üì                              ‚Üì
            AgentState (conversation context)  35+ tools
                ‚Üì
            TwiML Response ‚Üí Twilio ‚Üí User
```

#### **MCP Tool Categories:**
1. **Personal Productivity** (14 tools): create_todo, get_todos, update_todo, delete_todo, complete_todo, create_reminder, get_reminders, etc.
2. **Team Management** (6 tools): create_team, get_teams, get_team_members, add_team_member, remove_team_member, change_member_role
3. **Authentication** (2 tools): verify_user_pin, search_users
4. **Calendar Sync** (6 tools): create_calendar_event, sync_google_calendar_events, test_google_calendar, etc.

3. **Speech-to-Digit Conversion**: Natural PIN entry ("one two three four" ‚Üí "1234")
4. **Database Migration System**: Auto-running migrations on deployment
5. **Self-Healing Scripts**: `check_admin_user.py` auto-detects and fixes database issues
6. **Timeout Management**: 30s agent timeout, 20s tool timeout for reliability

---

## Challenges we ran into

### **1. Circular Import Hell üîÑ**
**Problem**: The MCP server (`db_todo.py`) imported team models, which triggered `sambanova/__init__.py`, which imported `routes.py`, which initialized the `TodoAgent`, which required OpenAI API key‚Äîall before environment variables were loaded!

**Solution**: 
- Lazy agent initialization with `get_agent()` function
- Lazy model imports with `_lazy_import_team_models()`
- Moved `Base` class to separate `sambanova/models/base.py`

### **2. MCP JSON Protocol Breaking üí•**
**Problem**: Print statements in `db_todo.py` were outputting non-JSON to stdout, breaking the JSONRPC protocol:
```
Failed to parse JSONRPC message from server
pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: Invalid JSON
```

**Solution**: Systematically removed **all** print statements from MCP server, replaced with `logging.info()` or comments.

### **3. Google Calendar Events Not Visible üìÖ**
**Problem**: Events were created successfully but not visible in user's personal calendar.

**Root Cause**: Service account was creating events in its own calendar, not the user's.

**Solution**: 
- Switched from service accounts to OAuth2 client credentials
- Created `generate_oauth2_token.py` script for local OAuth flow
- Base64-encoded token and stored in `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_TOKEN_B64` environment variable

### **4. Agent Timeout Issues ‚è±Ô∏è**
**Problem**: Google Calendar API calls took 8-12 seconds, causing agent timeouts (was 12s overall, 10s stream).

**Solution**: Increased timeouts to 30s overall, 25s stream, 20s per tool.

### **5. ExceptionGroup in Async Tools ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**Problem**: MCP tools were failing with `unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception)`.

**Root Cause**: Python 3.11+ TaskGroup wraps exceptions in ExceptionGroup.

**Solution**: Added explicit ExceptionGroup unwrapping:
```python
except ExceptionGroup as eg:
    for exc in eg.exceptions:
        logger.error(f"Tool execution error: {exc}")
```

### **6. Team Dropdown Empty Despite Teams Existing ü§î**
**Problem**: Team dropdown showed "Select a team..." but no teams appeared.

**Root Cause**: SQLAlchemy relationships were commented out in `user_models.py`, breaking `membership.team` access.

**Solution**: 
- Uncommented relationships
- Used explicit JOIN queries to avoid relationship issues
- Added JWT expiry detection on frontend

### **7. Speech PIN Recognition üó£Ô∏è**
**Problem**: User says "one two three four", system receives that as text, but code expected digits.

**Solution**: Created word-to-number mapping:
```python
number_words = {
    'zero': '0', 'oh': '0', 'one': '1', 'two': '2', ...
}
"one two three four" ‚Üí "1234"
```

### **8. Missing Database Column in Production üíæ**
**Problem**: 
```
psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column users_sambanova.voice_pin does not exist
```

**Solution**: 
- Created migration system in `deploy_setup.py`
- Auto-running migrations on deployment
- Self-healing `check_admin_user.py` that auto-adds missing columns

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

### **1. Natural Voice Interaction üéôÔ∏è**
We built a voice assistant that feels genuinely conversational. You can say "Create a high priority todo to review the quarterly report due tomorrow" and it just works. No rigid command structure, no "press 1 for this, press 2 for that"‚Äîjust natural language.

### **2. Enterprise-Grade Team Collaboration üè¢**
Full role-based access control, team hierarchies, task assignment, and member management‚Äîall accessible via voice. This is production-ready team workflow automation.

### **3. Seamless Google Calendar Integration üìÖ**
Every todo, reminder, and event automatically syncs to Google Calendar. Your assistant updates your calendar in real-time, visible in Google Calendar app, Gmail, and any other calendar client.

### **4. Robust Error Handling üõ°Ô∏è**
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Intelligent retry logic for API calls
- User-friendly error messages ("I'm having trouble with that right now")
- Auto-recovery from database schema issues

### **5. PIN Authentication That Actually Works üîê**
Supporting both DTMF (keypad) and speech input for PINs was tricky, but we nailed it. Users can say "one two three four" or press 1234#‚Äîboth work perfectly.

### **6. 35+ MCP Tools Orchestration üîß**
Built a comprehensive tool ecosystem that the agent can intelligently combine:
- Multi-step workflows (create team ‚Üí add members ‚Üí create todo)
- Context-aware tool selection
- Parallel tool execution where possible
- Dynamic tool composition based on user intent

### **7. Self-Healing Infrastructure üîÑ**
Our deployment system automatically:
- Runs database migrations
- Fixes schema inconsistencies
- Sets up demo users
- Tests critical integrations
- Recovers from common errors

### **8. Complete Technical Documentation üìö**
We created extensive documentation:
- `TEAM_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - API usage and features
- `PIN_AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md` - Authentication system details
- `DEPLOYMENT_VOICE_PIN_FIX.md` - Deployment troubleshooting
- `HACKATHON_PROJECT_STORY.md` - This comprehensive project story
- `sambanova_tech_spec.html` - Interactive technical specification with diagrams

## What we learned

### **1. Architecture Matters Early üèóÔ∏è**
We spent the first 30% of development time fighting circular imports and import order issues. Starting with a clear separation of concerns (models, routes, services, MCP servers) would have saved days.

**Lesson**: Draw the dependency graph **before** writing code, not after you have 2000 lines of spaghetti.

### **2. MCP Protocol is Strict But Powerful üì°**
The Model Context Protocol is incredibly powerful for AI agents, but it's **extremely** sensitive to stdout pollution. One stray print statement breaks everything.

**Lesson**: Use structured logging from day one. Never use print() in server code.

### **3. OAuth2 vs Service Accounts: Choose Wisely üîë**
Service accounts are great for backend automation, but for user-facing features (like personal calendars), OAuth2 is mandatory.

**Lesson**: Understand authentication flows **before** implementing integrations. The auth model shapes your entire UX.

### **4. Voice UX ‚â† Web UX üó£Ô∏è**
Designing for voice requires completely different patterns:
- Confirmations are critical ("I've created a todo titled 'Review report'. Is that correct?")
- Error messages must be conversational, not technical
- Users need feedback at each step
- Silence is confusing‚Äîalways respond with something

**Lesson**: Test with real phone calls early and often. Voice interactions feel different than you imagine.

### **5. Database Migrations in Production Are Scary üò∞**
We deployed code expecting a `voice_pin` column that didn't exist. Production broke. Panic ensued.

**Lesson**: 
- Always test migrations locally first
- Use migration frameworks (Alembic) for complex schemas
- Build self-healing scripts as safety nets
- Never assume production DB matches your local schema

### **6. Async Python is Wonderful and Terrible üé≠**
Async/await makes everything faster, but debugging TaskGroup exceptions at 2 AM is not fun.

**Lesson**: 
- Understand ExceptionGroup in Python 3.11+
- Use proper exception unwrapping
- Log **everything** in async code
- Test timeout scenarios explicitly

### **7. User Authentication is Never "Just Username and Password" üîê**
We implemented three different auth systems:
1. JWT for web dashboard
2. PIN for voice calls
3. OAuth2 for Google Calendar

Each has different security models, token lifetimes, and refresh logic.

**Lesson**: Plan for multiple auth contexts from the start. They will compound in complexity.

### **8. AI Agents Need Guardrails ü§ñ**
Without careful prompt engineering, the agent would:
- Try to create teams without checking if they exist
- Assign tasks to non-existent users
- Interpret ambiguous requests incorrectly

**Lesson**: 
- Provide explicit tool usage guidelines in system prompt
- Include step-by-step examples for complex workflows
- Define critical rules (validation, error handling)
- Test edge cases extensively

### **9. Documentation is a Feature, Not an Afterthought üìñ**
Our comprehensive guides saved us multiple times during debugging and helped new team members onboard instantly.

**Lesson**: Write docs **as you code**, not after. Future you will thank present you.

### **10. Deployment is Part of the Product üöÄ**
A system that works locally but fails in production is worthless. Our auto-migration system turned deployment from a nightmare into a non-event.

**Lesson**: Invest in deployment automation early. Build for production from day one.
