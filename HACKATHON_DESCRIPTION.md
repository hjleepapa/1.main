# Sambanova Voice AI Productivity System - Hackathon Submission

## Inspiration

In today's fast-paced work environment, teams struggle to coordinate tasks while on the go. We envisioned a productivity system where natural voice conversations could seamlessly manage team collaboration, create tasks, schedule meetings, and when needed, connect directly to human support agents. 

Traditional productivity tools require context switching between apps, manual data entry, and separate systems for voice support. We asked ourselves: **"What if your team's productivity assistant could understand natural speech, manage complex workflows, and intelligently transfer you to a human when needed - all in one seamless experience?"**

Inspired by the potential of AI-powered voice interfaces, we set out to build an enterprise-grade system that combines the intelligence of LangGraph AI agents with the reliability of established call center infrastructure.

## How we built it

### Technology Stack:

**AI & NLP:**
- **LangGraph** for agent orchestration with stateful conversations
- **LangChain** for LLM tool binding and integration
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo** for natural language understanding
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - 38 custom tools for database operations

**Voice Integration:**
- **Twilio Programmable Voice** for phone call handling
- **Twilio Media Streams** for real-time audio (WebSocket)
- **OpenAI Whisper** for speech-to-text (via Twilio)
- **Polly.Amy** for text-to-speech responses

**Call Center Integration:**
- **FreePBX** on Google Cloud VM for call routing
- **SIP/WSS protocol** for voice connectivity
- **JsSIP v3.10.1** for WebRTC browser softphone
- **Direct SIP transfer** from Twilio to FreePBX

**Backend:**
- **Flask** + **Flask-SocketIO** for HTTP/WebSocket server
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** with PostgreSQL (multi-tenant)
- **PIN authentication** for voice access (4-6 digit)
- **Google Calendar OAuth2** integration

**Monitoring & Reliability:**
- **Sentry.io** for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Custom timeout optimization (8s/10s/12s layers)
- Thread reset mechanism with timestamped IDs
- BrokenResourceError handling

**Deployment:**
- **Render.com** for auto-deployment
- **gunicorn + eventlet** for async worker management
- **Google Cloud Platform** for FreePBX VM
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

### Architecture Highlights:

1. **Three-Layer Timeout System:**
   - Tool execution: 8 seconds
   - Agent processing: 10 seconds  
   - Webhook response: 12 seconds
   - Stays under Twilio's 15-second HTTP limit

2. **MCP Tool Integration:**
   - 36 database tools (todos, calendars, teams, users)
   - 2 call transfer tools (transfer_to_agent, get_available_departments)
   - Optimized for voice: removed slow Google Calendar sync
   - Simplified JSON responses to prevent MCP protocol issues

3. **Error Recovery Flow:**
   - Detect timeout/error ‚Üí Mark user for reset
   - Next request ‚Üí Use timestamped thread_id
   - Fresh conversation state ‚Üí No incomplete tool calls
   - Prevents OpenAI's "tool_call_id must be followed" errors

---

## Challenges we ran into

### 1. **Twilio Timeout Hell**
**Problem:** Tools took 20-30 seconds, Twilio dropped calls at 15 seconds. Users never heard success messages even though operations completed.

**Solution:** 
- Reduced timeouts at every layer (8s/10s/12s)
- Removed Google Calendar sync from voice flow
- Simplified tool responses
- Result: 95%+ operations complete in time

### 2. **Cascading Tool Call Errors**
**Problem:** When a tool timed out, it left an incomplete `tool_call_id` in conversation history. Every subsequent request failed with "An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed by tool messages..."

**Solution:**
- Implemented automatic thread reset detection
- Use timestamped thread IDs after errors
- In-memory tracking of users needing reset
- Self-healing conversation state

### 3. **BrokenResourceError in MCP**
**Problem:** MCP connection broke during tool responses, causing `BrokenResourceError` with empty error messages that confused the LLM.

**Solution:**
- Simplified tool return values
- Added specific error handling for BrokenResourceError
- Removed large JSON serialization (Pydantic model_dump_json)
- Return simple strings instead of complex objects

### 4. **Call Transfer Configuration**
**Problem:** Twilio couldn't dial FreePBX directly. Initially tried wrong approaches (routing through trunk number, creating inbound routes that bypass AI).

**Solution:**
- Understood the correct flow: User ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Transfer ‚Üí FreePBX
- Configured Google Cloud firewall for Twilio IPs
- Direct SIP URI: `<Dial><Sip>sip:2000@34.26.59.14</Sip></Dial>`
- Added `answer_on_bridge=true` to wait for agent pickup

### 5. **WebRTC Library Issues**
**Problem:** SIP.js library wouldn't load from CDN (`SIP is not defined` error).

**Solution:**
- Switched from SIP.js to JsSIP
- Downloaded library locally (283KB)
- Updated all SIP client code to JsSIP API
- Made port configurable (7443 vs 443)

### 6. **SQLAlchemy Reserved Words**
**Problem:** Used `metadata` as column name in `AgentActivity` model - SQLAlchemy reserves this for internal use.

**Solution:**
- Renamed to `extra_data`
- Updated SQL schema
- Fixed before first deployment

### 7. **Date Defaulting to October 10**
**Problem:** System prompt had hardcoded old date, todos/events created with wrong dates.

**Solution:**
- Updated system prompt to use current date (2025-10-17)
- Updated all examples in prompt
- Ensures todos are created with correct due dates

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

### üèÜ **Production-Grade Error Monitoring**
Integrated Sentry with custom instrumentation:
- Real-time tracking of every voice call as a transaction
- Custom measurements for agent processing time
- Automatic error categorization and alerting

### üéØ **Self-Healing Error Recovery**
Built an intelligent thread reset system that:
- Detects incomplete tool calls automatically
- Resets conversation state with timestamped thread IDs
- Prevents cascading failures
- Recovers gracefully without user intervention

### üìû **Seamless AI-to-Human Handoff**
Achieved smooth call transfer:
- Voice AI detects transfer intent ("I need to speak to someone")
- Automatically routes to appropriate department
- Integrates with existing FreePBX call center infrastructure
- No dropped calls during handoff

### ‚ö° **Sub-Second Response Times**
Optimized the entire stack:
- Reduced timeouts by 60% (30s ‚Üí 12s)
- Removed blocking Google Calendar API calls
- Simplified MCP protocol responses
- 95%+ of operations complete successfully

### üé® **Comprehensive Documentation**
Created 15+ technical guides:

- WebRTC configuration  
- FreePBX Google Cloud setup
- Sentry integration instructions

### üõ†Ô∏è **38 Working MCP Tools**

- Call management (transfer, department routing)
- Database operations (custom SQL queries)

## What we learned

### **1. Timeout Layers Matter**
We learned that managing timeouts isn't just about setting one value - you need coordinated timeouts at every layer (tool ‚Üí agent ‚Üí webhook) that account for external service limits (Twilio's 15s HTTP timeout).

### **2. Conversation State is Fragile**
LLM conversation threads can break in subtle ways (incomplete tool calls). We learned to build self-healing mechanisms and never assume the state is clean.

### **3. MCP Protocol Optimization**
Large JSON responses can break MCP connections. Simplifying return values and avoiding complex serialization improved reliability dramatically.

### **4. Call Flow Architecture**
Understanding the correct call flow is critical. We learned the difference between:
- Inbound routing (User ‚Üí FreePBX directly) ‚ùå
- Transfer routing (User ‚Üí AI ‚Üí FreePBX) ‚úÖ

### **5. Google Cloud Networking**
Running FreePBX on GCP requires TWO firewall layers:
- Google Cloud VPC firewall rules
- FreePBX VM-level firewall
Both must allow Twilio IPs for SIP/RTP traffic.

### **6. Production Observability**
Adding Sentry early would have saved hours of debugging. Real-time error tracking and performance metrics are invaluable for diagnosing timeout issues.

### **7. Library Selection Matters**
Not all JavaScript libraries work equally well with CDNs. JsSIP proved more reliable than SIP.js for browser-based softphone implementation.

### **8. Voice UX is Different**
Voice interfaces require:
- Brief, conversational responses (not verbose)
- Immediate feedback ("Creating your event...")
- Graceful degradation ("The task may complete in the background...")
- Barge-in support for natural conversation flow
