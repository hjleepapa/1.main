## 🎯 What Gets Tracked

### Automatic (Built-in):
- ✅ All uncaught exceptions
- ✅ HTTP request/response
- ✅ SQL queries
- ✅ Response times
- ✅ Stack traces

### Custom (Added by me):
- ✅ Voice call transactions
- ✅ Agent processing time
- ✅ Tool execution duration
- ✅ Thread resets
- ✅ Timeout events
- ✅ BrokenResourceError occurrences
- ✅ tool_call_id errors

---

## 📊 Sentry Dashboard Views

### Issues Dashboard
```
Today's Errors:
- BrokenResourceError: 12 occurrences
- tool_call_incomplete: 8 occurrences
- Agent timeout: 5 occurrences
```

### Performance Dashboard
```
Average agent_processing_time: 3.2s
P95 processing time: 8.5s
Slowest operations:
1. get_calendar_events - 11.2s
2. create_calendar_event - 9.8s
3. get_teams - 7.1s
```

### Alerts
```
⚠️  Error rate increased by 50% in last hour
⚠️  P95 response time exceeded 10s threshold
✅  Thread reset rate within normal range
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@xxx.ingest.us.sentry.io/xxx

# Optional (auto-set by Render)
RENDER=true
RENDER_ENVIRONMENT=production
RENDER_GIT_COMMIT=abc123def
```

### Sentry Settings

```python
# app.py:41-57
traces_sample_rate=1.0,  # 100% for demo/development
profiles_sample_rate=1.0,  # 100% profiling
environment="production" if RENDER else "development",
release=RENDER_GIT_COMMIT,
```

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Local Testing:

```bash
# 1. Add SENTRY_DSN to .env
echo "SENTRY_DSN=https://your-key@..." >> .env

# 2. Restart app
python app.py

# 3. Check console
# Should see: ✅ Sentry initialized: environment=development

# 4. Make test call or API request
# 5. Check Sentry dashboard for transaction
```

### Production Testing (After Deploy):

```
1. Deploy to Render (git push)
2. Make voice call to +12344007818
3. Open Sentry dashboard
4. Should see transaction appear in real-time
```

## 🎓 What to Tell Judges

### Short Version:
"We use Sentry for production-grade error monitoring and performance tracking. It captures all errors automatically and provides real-time insights into our voice AI system."

### Detailed Version:
"Our system integrates Sentry for comprehensive observability. Every voice call is tracked as a transaction, measuring agent processing time, tool execution, and any errors. We track custom metrics like thread resets and timeouts to ensure reliability. The dashboard provides real-time visibility into system health and user experience."

  },
  "contexts": {
    "voice_call": {
      "call_sid": "CA5c595e...",
      "transcribed_text": "Create a todo for shopping"
    }
  }
}
```

### Event 2: Timeout Warning
```json
{
  "level": "warning",
  "message": "Agent processing timeout",
  "extra": {
    "user_id": "2481f0e8...",
    "call_sid": "CA5c595e...",
    "prompt": "What calendar events do I have?",
    "timeout_duration": 12.4
  }
}
```

### Event 3: Thread Reset

## 💡 Advanced Features (Post-Hackathon)

### Custom Dashboards
```python
# Track tool usage stats
sentry_sdk.set_tag("tool_name", "create_todo")
sentry_sdk.set_measurement("tool_execution_time", duration, "second")
```

### User Feedback
```python
# Let users report issues
sentry_sdk.capture_user_feedback({
    "event_id": event_id,
    "name": user.name,
    "email": user.email,
    "comments": "Voice recognition was poor"
})
```

### Release Tracking
```python
# Automatically done via RENDER_GIT_COMMIT
# Compare error rates between releases
```
