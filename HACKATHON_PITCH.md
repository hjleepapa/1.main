# Sambanova Voice AI Productivity System

## Inspiration

Traditional productivity tools force you to context-switch between apps, type everything manually, and use separate systems when you need human help. We imagined a world where you could manage your entire team's workflow through natural voice conversations - and when the AI can't help, seamlessly connect to a human agent.

We were inspired by how much time teams waste on task management overhead. **What if you could create todos, schedule meetings, assign tasks to teammates, and get human support - all through one phone call?**

## What it does

Sambanova is an enterprise voice AI productivity assistant that:

- üìû **Voice-First Productivity:** Call a phone number, authenticate with voice PIN, manage your entire workflow through conversation
- üë• **Team Collaboration:** Multi-tenant teams with role-based access, assign tasks to members by voice ("Assign code review to John")
- üîÑ **Intelligent Call Transfer:** When AI can't help, automatically transfers to human agents at FreePBX call center (extension 2000)
- üìä **Production Monitoring:** Real-time error tracking with Sentry, performance metrics, automatic error recovery
- üåê **WebRTC Call Center:** Browser-based softphone for agents using JsSIP on FreePBX
- üìÖ **Smart Scheduling:** Google Calendar integration, natural language date parsing ("tomorrow at 2 PM")

**38 MCP tools** power everything from creating todos to managing team memberships to transferring calls.

## How we built it

**AI Stack:**
- LangGraph for stateful agent orchestration
- OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo for natural language understanding
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) with 38 custom tools
- LangChain for LLM tool binding

**Voice Infrastructure:**
- Twilio Programmable Voice for call handling
- Twilio Media Streams for real-time audio
- FreePBX on Google Cloud VM for call center
- SIP/WSS protocol for voice routing

**Backend:**
- Flask + Flask-SocketIO (HTTP + WebSocket)
- PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy (multi-tenant)
- PIN authentication (4-6 digit voice access)
- JWT + bcrypt for web authentication

**DevOps:**
- Sentry.io for error monitoring & performance tracking
- Render.com auto-deployment with gunicorn+eventlet
- Google Cloud Platform for FreePBX VM
- Comprehensive timeout optimization (8s/10s/12s layers)

## Challenges we ran into

**1. Twilio's 15-Second Timeout Wall**
Tools took 20-30 seconds, but Twilio drops HTTP requests at 15 seconds. Users heard operations start but never got confirmation.
- *Solution:* Three-layer timeout system (8s/10s/12s), removed slow Google Calendar sync, simplified responses. Now 95%+ operations complete in time.

**2. Cascading Tool Call Failures**
When tools timed out, they left incomplete `tool_call_id` in conversation history. Every subsequent request failed with OpenAI errors.
- *Solution:* Automatic thread reset with timestamped IDs. System detects incomplete states and starts fresh conversations automatically.

**3. MCP Connection Breaking**
BrokenResourceError with empty messages crashed during tool responses.
- *Solution:* Simplified JSON responses, added specific error handling, removed Pydantic large object serialization.

**4. Call Transfer Complexity**
Connecting Twilio voice calls to FreePBX required understanding SIP routing, Google Cloud firewall (2 layers!), and correct TwiML generation.
- *Solution:* Direct SIP URI dialing with proper error callbacks and status tracking.

**5. WebRTC Library Loading**
SIP.js wouldn't load from CDN in production environments.
- *Solution:* Switched to JsSIP, hosted locally (283KB), updated entire client codebase.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

‚úÖ **Production-Ready Monitoring:** Sentry integration with custom metrics - not just a demo feature  
‚úÖ **Self-Healing Architecture:** Automatic error recovery that actually works  
‚úÖ **Real Call Center Integration:** Working transfer from AI to human agents on FreePBX  
‚úÖ **38 Working Tools:** Complete productivity suite via MCP  
‚úÖ **Sub-5s Responses:** Optimized from 30+ seconds to under 5 seconds  
‚úÖ **Zero Cascading Failures:** Thread reset prevents error propagation  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Docs:** 15+ guides covering every integration  
‚úÖ **Multi-Tenant Teams:** Full RBAC with owner/admin/member/viewer roles  

## What we learned

**Timeout coordination is an art:** You can't just set one timeout value. Every layer needs progressively shorter timeouts, and you must account for external service limits you can't control.

**Conversation state needs babysitting:** LLMs don't handle interrupted tool calls gracefully. Building automatic recovery mechanisms is essential for production systems.

**Observability from day one:** Adding Sentry early would have saved us hours. Being able to see exactly where time is spent and what's failing in production is invaluable.

**Voice UX is fundamentally different:** Responses must be brief, conversational, and include progress updates. Users can't see what's happening, so you have to tell them.

**Integration complexity compounds:** Each service (Twilio, FreePBX, Google Calendar, OpenAI) has its own constraints. Making them work together smoothly requires deep understanding of each.

**Documentation is a feature:** With 5+ integrated services, good documentation isn't optional - it's what makes the project usable.

## What's next for Sambanova

**Immediate (Next Month):**
- **Redpanda event streaming** for real-time analytics dashboard
- **WebSocket voice streaming** for faster responses (no HTTP latency)
- **Sentiment analysis** for automatic escalation to human agents
- **Meeting transcription** with automatic action item extraction

**Medium-Term (Next Quarter):**
- **Mobile apps** (iOS/Android) with offline mode
- **Slack/Teams integration** for notifications
- **CRM integration** (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- **Custom AI model fine-tuning** per organization
- **Multi-language support** (Spanish, Mandarin)

**Long-Term (Next Year):**
- **Multi-agent workflows:** AI agents that collaborate with each other
- **Predictive task management:** AI suggests tasks based on team patterns
- **White-label platform:** Customizable for enterprise customers
- **Plugin marketplace:** Third-party tool integrations
- **Edge deployment:** Low-latency global distribution

**Bold Vision:** Make Sambanova the **de-facto voice interface for enterprise productivity** - where every team has an AI assistant that knows their workflow, handles routine tasks instantly, and connects to humans seamlessly when needed.

## Why This Matters

We're not just building another todo app. We're building the bridge between AI automation and human expertise. The future isn't AI replacing humans - **it's AI and humans working together seamlessly**, and our call transfer feature embodies that vision.

With Sentry monitoring, we're showing that hackathon projects can be built with production-grade practices from day one. With our error recovery system, we're proving that AI systems can be resilient and self-healing.

**This is productivity, reimagined for the AI age.** üöÄ
